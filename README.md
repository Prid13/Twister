# Twister
PHP-based update fetcher to monitor certain changes on any website.

## TODO List
- [ ] Send ERROR if setInitFunction and setHandler methods are missing
- [ ] Send "Something might be wrong" message after X days if the fetching script is failing multiple times (if website has changed or doesn't exist anymore)
